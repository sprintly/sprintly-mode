* sprintly-mode
sprintly-mode is a small mode for http://sprint.ly/, a project
management tool. It is a work in progress and pull requests and github
issues are accepted.
** Working Features
- List your tickets.
** Future feature ideas
- Group your tickets based on status.
- Nagivate to tickets.
- Auto-complete inside a magit-commit buffer for ticket ids. ie # key will open auto complete.
- Create new tickets from within emacs.
- Create branch of repository for working on a given feature.
- Support for multiple products.
** Known Issues
- You need to find out your own user id. I did this by poking around
  in the json api.
- Another alternative is to go to Sprintly and filter tasks clicking "Mine".

It will be in the following format:

https://sprint.ly/product/PRODUCT_ID/#!/items/#members=USER_ID&statuses=backlog,current&sub-items=true
